# StaggeredSynthDiD: Synthetic Difference-in-Differences Estimation for Staggered Adoption Settings

This package extends the synthetic Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimator by Arkhangelsky et al. (2021) to staggered adoption settings.
As proposed in the Appendix of Arkhangelsky et al. (2021), the estimator is applied repeatedly, once for every adoption date, and a weighted average is calculated.
It builds on the **synthdid package** by David Hirshberg.
